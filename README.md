# Time-table-checker
At the end of year 11 our school offered A level taster sessions, however my friends had all choosen different subjects and we were unsure when all of us would be free to meet up or go out.
So I made program which asks the user to enter a date, and outputs who all is free during every period.
However since not all my friends were familiar with python, I had to make an interface using Tkinter so that all my friends could use my program without any issue
